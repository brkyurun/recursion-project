# recursion-project

In this project, I started learning about recursion and tried to apply the theory into real world with a timeless classic for recursive algorithms, the Fibonacci Sequence!

## Assignment 01

This folder contains the iterative and recursive approaches to the Fibonacci Sequence. Both functions return an array containing the _nth_ number in the sequence as the last array item.

## Assignment 02

This folder contains an adaptation of the merge sort algorithm. Not much to say about that, it was quite a challenge for me.
